AWS Elastic Beanstalk Applications: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. 
It simplifies the process by handling the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring. 
You can upload your code, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically manages the deployment, including creating an environment, deploying the application, and monitoring its health2.

AWS CodePipeline for Automated Deployment and CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service.
It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications and infrastructure changes. With CodePipeline, you can define your workflow as a 
series of stages, such as building code, testing it, and deploying it to production. This automation ensures a rapid, reliable release cycle, reducing human 
errors and speeding up the time it takes to deliver software updates4.

By combining AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CodePipeline, you can achieve automated, region-specific deployment and CI/CD. This setup allows you to deploy 
applications efficiently across different regions, ensuring consistency and reliability in your deployment process.
